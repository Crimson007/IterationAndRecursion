# Iterative and Recursive Factorials - CIS 261 Lab 2

## Description
This C# console application demonstrates two ways to calculate factorials:
1. **Iterative approach**: Uses a `for` loop to multiply numbers sequentially
2. **Recursive approach**: The function calls itself with smaller values until reaching the base case

Created for CIS 261 to fulfill these requirements:
- Write an iterative factorial function
- Write a recursive factorial function
- Test both functions with numbers 1, 5, 8, 10, and 12

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022
2. Press **F5** to run the program
3. View the factorial results in the console window
